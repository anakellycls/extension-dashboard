# qs-extension-usage-dashboard
The Qlik Sense Extension Usage Dashboard is a Qlik application that parses application meta-data to uncover which applications use extension objects. The sources for this data are the meta-data fetch from the Qlik Sense Telemetry project (https://github.com/eapowertools/qs-telemetry-dashboard) and QRS API calls. By combining these, we can see which apps use extensions, where those extensions are used, who are the users who use extensions, which extensions are _not_ used, as well as which extension usages could be replaced by a bundled visualization from Qlik.
